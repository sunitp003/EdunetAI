# Spam Email Classifier

## Introduction
The **Spam Email Classifier** is a machine learning project designed to automatically classify emails as either "spam" or "not spam" (ham). This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to detect spam emails based on their content.

## Features
- **Email Classification**: Classifies emails into spam and ham categories.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the email content for machine learning models.
- **Model Training**: Uses algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to classify emails.
- **Evaluation**: Measures the accuracy of the model using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `sklearn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `nltk`

You can install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
